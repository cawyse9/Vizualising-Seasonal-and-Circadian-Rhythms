## Chronic Inflammation: The Friendly Fire of the Immune System
The word inflammation is derived from the Latin ~inflame~, meaning “to set on fire”, an apt description for the bombardment of reactive biochemicals that surges from inflamed white blood cells.  Macrophages are the frontline responder cells of the immune system, and by colouring them with an oxidation-sensitive dye, we were able to image the furore of their response to inflammatory stimuli in real-time.  Inflammation is a powerful defence against injury and disease, but failure of systemic regulation of this fiery mechanism damages the host tissues and leads to chronic disease.

##  Seasons Greetings  
The long nights of winter affect glial cells (in red and green) at the junction between the brain and pituitary gland to regulate seasonal patterns in physiology in animals. Studying how daylength can affect physiology helps us to understand the reasons why many diseases are more common in wintertime.
 

## The Metronome of the Mind  
The suprachiasmatic nucleus (in yellow) is the master clock of the brain, timing physiology and behaviour to ensure that we are hungry, sleepy and alert at the right
times of day.

## Immune Clocks
Macrophages are the soldiers, sentinels and messengers of the immune system. Our studies show that these cells have their own molecular clock that allows them to
synchronise these protective roles to the times of day that we need them most.
